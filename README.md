# Hotels_Data_Analysis
A data analysis project exploring hotel booking trends using Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries.”
# Hotels Data Analysis | Jupyter Notebook Project

This repository contains a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project performed on hotel booking data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis focuses on understanding booking behavior, guest patterns, cancellation trends, seasonal demand, and factors that influence customer decisions.

## 1. Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze hotel booking data to identify patterns and trends that can support data-driven decision-making in the hospitality industry. The notebook covers data cleaning, transformation, exploration, and visualization.

## 2. Key Objectives
- Analyze booking distribution across various customer segments.
- Identify cancellation trends and contributing factors.
- Understand seasonal and monthly demand patterns.
- Explore guest demographics and stay characteristics.
- Visualize insights using clear and meaningful charts.

## 3. Technologies and Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 4. Project File
- Hotels_Data_Analysis.ipynb  
  Contains the full data cleaning workflow, exploratory analysis, and visualizations.

## 5. What the Analysis Includes
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Data formatting and preprocessing
- Statistical summary of important variables
- Visualizations including:
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Booking trends
  - Cancellation analysis
  - Lead time patterns
  - Distribution and comparison plots
- Key insights and business conclusions

## 6. How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotels-data-analysis.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd hotels-data-analysis

3. Install required libraries:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook

5. Open the file:
   Hotels_Data_Analysis.ipynb

## 7. Future Improvements
